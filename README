nrast -> Nathans RASTerizer
Very small software 3d renderer programmed in C (1.4k LOC).
You will need SDL2, though, but that's about it (standard c library is needed, of course).
Changing Z and Y rotations can make movement and rotation kind of weird.

	W - Move forward
	A - Move left
	S - Move backward
	D - Move right
	E - Move down
	Q - Move up
	I - Look up
	J - Look left
	K - Look down
	L - Look right
	U - Spin clockwise
	O - Spin counterclockwise
