nrast -> Nathans RASTerizer
Very small software 3d renderer programmed in C (1.4k LOC).
You will need SDL2, though, but that's about it (standard c library is needed, of course).

TODO:
Depth buffer sometimes doesn't work. But it's a lot better than before.
Everything is kinda "foggy" when you run it.
This is because I have COMMON_SHOW_DEPTH_BUFFER on, this is for debugging purposes.
Yup, I'm still debebugging, ugh, I'll get it working eventually.
